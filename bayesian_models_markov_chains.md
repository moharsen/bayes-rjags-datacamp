## Research topic: Sleep deprivation

**Research Question**
How does sleep deprivation impact reaction time?
**The Study**
\* measure reaction time on Day 0\* restrict sleep to 3 hours per night
\* measure reaction time on Day 3\* measure the change in reaction time

\(Y_i\) = change in reaction time(ms) for subject *i*

**Assume**\(Y_i\) are Normally distributed around some average change
in reaction time m with standard deviation *s*.

\(Y_i\sim N(m, s^2)\)

\_\_Prior model for parameter
 $m$
\_\_\(Y_i\) = change in reaction time (ms)\(Y_i\sim N(m, s^2)\)
\(m = average Y_i\)

**Prior information:** + with normal sleep, average reaction time is
\~250 ms + expect average to ↗ by\~50 ms + average is unlikely to ↘ &
unlikely to ↗ by more than\~150 ms
